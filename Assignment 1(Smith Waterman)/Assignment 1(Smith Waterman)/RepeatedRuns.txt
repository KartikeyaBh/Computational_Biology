I am testing Mso::Branding::GetAppValue(Mso::Branding::AppValueTypes::NameVersion, L"Word")
My goal is to check if the About page in skype for business shows office 2019. We use the ShowHelpAbout api for that. And it internally calls this. So I thought it should work automatically for us. But when I tested on devc2r it was still office 2016. My checkpoint was 9017.1000
