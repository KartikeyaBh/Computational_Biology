I have written the program in Visual C++. To increase the speed of execution I have used parallel patterns library of
Visual C++. To compile it you will need Visual C++. I run it from Developer command prompt for Visual studio.

If you dont have visual c++, you can compile it using standard by commenting out the parallel portion of the source
and uncommenting the serial section. Serial takes a long time to execute.

Please contact me at karbha@microsoft.com or 425-449-1962 if you are having trouble building it.

1. cl.exe /EHsc "Assignment 1(Smith Waterman).cpp" (I run it from Developer command prompt for Visual studio.)
2. It will produce an exe which you can execute.

Alternatively you can run the exe attached. The exe would require the obj files to execute. I am sorry for attaching them. :)

The program will ask for three choices.
0 - If you have accession numbers of the proteins. Make sure the fasta files are present in the same folder.
1 - If you want the 10 X 10 results of all proteins. Again, make sure that all fasta files for the proteins are present.
2 - If you want to enter the protein sequences itself.

In each case it will print the score matrix if the sequence is less than 15.
The default for calculating empirical value is 999 iterations.

This program does parallel execution so it will take 100% of cpu when you execute. :)
On the upside it takes just 140 seconds to do 10^4 iterations.
